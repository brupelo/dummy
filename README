Simple dummy code that will help to discuss how to properly create multiple
flask websites attacking a single database. The idea is serve different content
with the same underlying code.

Domains
-------
www.domain1.com
www.domain2.com

Database
--------
www/dummy.db

Flask app
---------
dummy/dummy/app.py: Common models/views/factories
dummy/dummy/config_base.py: Common class that will be subclassed on different domains
